welome to my basketball chanell
Today i am going to teach you running. A person should learn how to run properly in order to play basketball. Avoid tittling your head and slumping your shoulders. Broaden your chest, and keep it lifted as you draw your shoulders down and back. keep your hands loose, and use a relaxed arm swing. Avoid crossing your arms in front of your body. To prevent injuries to your lower body,use a  midfoot strike, and avoid hitting the ground with your heel. this allows your foot to land directly under your hip as ypu drive your body for forward. A heel strike may cause your leg to slow down your stride and stress your knees
